## Overview

### The challenge

"Project Goals

In this project, youâ€™ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects."

## My process

### What I learned

This is my first time creating a table. I learned how to add a drop shadow using box-shadow and how to target every other row using tr:nth-last-of-type(even). I also learned how to use &lt &gt when writing tags as text. 

### Continued development

I need to learn more about overflow: hidden; and also specificity as I had to add an !important tag to get my hover to work on the rows which had a background colour.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Cheatsheet](https://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf) - I used this Cheatsheet as a reference. 
- [Creating Beautiful HTML Tables with CSS](https://dev.to/dcodeyt/creating-beautiful-html-tables-with-css-428l) - I used this tutorial to learn how to style a table with CSS.
- [Highlight Table Row](https://www.textfixer.com/tutorials/highlight-table-row.php) - I used this page to learn how to highlight a row on hover.
