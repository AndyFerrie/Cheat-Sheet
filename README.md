## Overview

### The challenge

"Project Goals

In this project, youâ€™ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects."

## My process

### What I learned

This is my first time creating a table. I learned how to add a drop shadow and how to target every other row using tr:nth-last-of-type(even).

### Continued development

I need to learn more about overflow: hidden; and also specificity as I had to add an !important tag to get my hover to work on the rows which had a background colour.

### Useful resources
